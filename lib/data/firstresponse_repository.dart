      Insect stings seldom have serious repercussions. They can cause extreme discomfort, especially if they are on the lips or in the mouth.
        1. Remove the sting with tweezers if it is a bee, wasp, or hornet sting. If you don't have tweezers, apply pressure around the sting to push it out.
        2. To ease itching, wash thoroughly with soap and water and use an antihistamine ointment or lotion.

       1. Treat the fracture right away.\n
           Unless life is in urgent danger from another source, do not move the patient until the wounded area has been immobilised. If circumstances prevent immediate immobilisation, perform a temporary repair to allow the patient to be transferred for a short distance to more suited and safe conditions. Before proceeding with fracture therapy, haemorrhage and serious wounds must be addressed, taking into account the needs of both types of injuries.
    2. Hold and support the damaged portions simultaneously, making movement impossible. This avoids additional damage and the increase in bleeding that occurs at the site of the fracture. It also protects the skin, blood vessels, nerves, and muscles from being pierced or damaged by shattered bone ends.
    3. Immobilize the fracture by wrapping it in bandages or using splints.
Bandages would be sufficient if the patient's body were used as a support. When there is a risk of prolonged or difficult travel before medical treatment is available, more splint support may be necessary. When both lower limbs are shattered, splints are required.
